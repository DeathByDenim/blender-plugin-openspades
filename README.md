# Blender plugin for export OpenSpades maps

This is very much a work in progress. To use, you need zip the \_\_init\_\_.py and add it as a plugin to Blender.

To export, select all the things you want to export, then Join, then apply a Remesh Modifier set to blocks. Apply the modifier and then you can export from File -> Export OpenSpades VXL

It is incredibly unoptimezed, be prepared to wait hours for large maps.
